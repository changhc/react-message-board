# web-hw2

This is a reddit-like message board.

## Feature
Reddit style. Cool, huh?

## Todo
1. Implement "load more comments". Now it displays all child comments, which can deteriorate UX.
2. Modify "child count". Now it just shows the number of "child" rather than all descendants as Reddit.
3. Implement up- and down-vote.

## Usage

#### Server
``` npm run start ```

#### Front-end only
``` npm run start ```

``` npm run build ``` to create an optimized version.
